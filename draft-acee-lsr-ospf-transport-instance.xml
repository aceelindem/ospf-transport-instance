	</t>
	<t>
	  This OSPF protocol extension provides functionality similar to

     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> 
        when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
     </section>

 <section title="OSPF Transport Instance">
     <t>  
   In order to isolate the effects of flooding and processing of non-
   routing information, it will be relegated to a separate protocol
   instance.  This instance should be given lower priority when
   contending for router resources including processing, backplane
   bandwidth, and line card bandwidth.  How that is realized is an
   implementation issue and is outside the scope of this document.
     </t>
     <t>
   Throughout the document, non-routing refers to routing information
   that is not used for IP or IPv6 routing calculations.  The OSPF
   transport instance is ideally suited for dissemination of routing
   information for other protocols and layers.
     </t> 

 <section title="OSPFv2 Transport Instance Packet Differentiation">
   <t>
   OSPFv2 currently does not offer a mechanism to differentiate Transport
   instance packets from normal instance packets sent and received on
   the same interface.  However, the <xref target="RFC6549"/> provides the
   necessary packet encoding to support multiple OSPF protocol instances.
   </t>
 </section>  

 <section title="OSPFv2 Transport Instance Packet Differentiation">
   <t>
   Fortunately, OSPFv3 already supports separate instances within the
   packet encodings.  The existing OSPFv3 packet header instance ID
   field will be used to differentiate packets received on the same link
   (refer to section 2.4 in <xref target="RFC5340"/>).
   </t>
 </section>
 
<section title="Instance Relationship to Normal OSPF Instances">
   <t>
   There are basically two alternatives for the relationship between a
   normal OSPF instance and an OSPF transport instance.  In both cases,
   we must guarantee that any information we've received is treated as
   valid if and only if the router sending it is reachable.  We'll refer
   to this as the "condition of reachability" in this document.
    <list style="numbers"> 

     <t>Ships in the Night - The OSPF transport instance has no
         relationship or dependency on any other OSPF instance.</t>

     <t>Child Instance - The OSPF transport instance has a child-parent
        relationship with a normal OSPF instance and is dependent on this
        for topology information and assuring the "condition of
         reachability".</t>
   </list></t>
 <section title="Ships in the Night Relationship to Normal OSPF Instances">
   <t>
   In this mode, the OSPF transport instance is not dependent on any
   other OSPF instance.  It does, however, have much of the same as
   topology information must be advertised to satisfy the "condition of
   reachability".
   </t>
   <t>
   Prefix information does not need to be advertised.  This implies that
   for OSPFv2, only router-LSAs, network-LSAs, and type 4 summary-LSAs
   need to be advertised.  In the router-LSAs, the stub (type 3) links
   may be suppressed.  For OSPFv3, this implies that router-LSAs,
   network-LSAs, and inter-area-router-LSAs must be advertised.
   </t>
 </section>
 
 <section title="Tighter Coupling with Normal OSPF Instances">
  <t>
   Further optimizations and coupling between an OSPF transport instance
   and a normal OSPF instance are beyond the scope of this document.
   This is an area for future study.
 </t>
</section>
</section>  

 <section title="Network Prioritization">
   <t>
   While OSPFv2 (section 4.3 in <xref target="RFC2328"/>) are normally sent with IP
   precedence Internetwork Control, any packets sent by an OSPF
   transport instance will be sent with IP precedence Flash (B'011').
   This is only appropriate given that this is a pretty flashy
   mechanism.
   </t>
   <t>
   Similarly, OSPFv3 transport instance packets will be sent with the
   traffic class mapped to flash (B'011') as specified in (<xref target="RFC5340"/>).
   </t>
   <t>
   By setting the IP/IPv6 precedence differently for OSPF transport
   instance packets, normal OSPF routing instances can be given priority
   during both packet transmission and reception.  In fact, some router
   implementations map the IP precedence directly to their internal
   packet priority.  However, internal router implementation decisions
   are beyond the scope of this document.
   </t>
 </section>

 <section title="OSPF Transport Instance Omission of Routing Calculation">
   <t>
   Since the whole point of the transport instance is to separate the
   routing and non-routing processing and fate sharing, a transport
   instance SHOULD NOT install any IP or IPv6 routes.  OSPF routers
   SHOULD NOT advertise any transport instance LSAs containing IP or
   IPv6 prefixes and OSPF routers receiving LSAs advertising IP or IPv6
   prefixes SHOULD ignore them.  This implies that an OSPFv2 transport
   instance Link State Database should not include any summary-LSAs
   (type 3) , AS-external-LSAs (type 5), or NSSA-LSAs (type 7) and the
   router-LSAs should not include any stub (type 3) links.  An OSPFv3
   transport instance Link State database should not include any inter-
   area-prefix-LSAs (type 0x2003), AS-external-LSAs (0x4005), NSSA-LSAs
   (type 0x2007), or intra-area-prefix-LSAs (type 0x2009).  If they are
   erroneously advertised, they will be flooded as per standard OSPF but
   MUST be ignored by OSPF routers supporting this specification.
  </t>
 </section>

 <section title="Non-routing Instance Separation">
  <t>
   It has been suggested that an implementation could obtain the same
   level of separation between IP routing information and non-routing
   information in a single instance with slight modifications to the
   OSPF protocol.  The authors refute this contention for the following
   reasons:
    <list style="symbols"> 
    <t>Adding internal and external mechanisms to prioritize routing
       information over non-routing information are much more complex
       than simply relegating the non-routing information to a separate
       instance as proposed in this specification.</t>

    <t>The instance boundary offers much better separation for allocation
       of finite resources such as buffers, memory, processor cores,
       sockets, and bandwidth.</t>

    <t>The instance boundary decreases the level of fate sharing for
       failures.  Each instance may be implemented as a separate process
       or task.</t>

     <t>With non-routing information, many times not every router in the
        OSPF routing domain requires knowledge of every piece of non-
        routing information.  In these cases, groups of routers which need
        to share information can be segregated into sparse topologies
        greatly reducing the amount of non-routing information any single
        router needs to maintain.</t>
    </list></t>
 </section>

 <section anchor="sparse" title="Non-Routing Sparse Topologies">
   <t>
   With non-routing information, many times not every router in the OSPF
   routing domain requires knowledge of every piece of non-routing
   information.  In these cases, groups of routers which need to share
   information can be segregated into sparse topologies.  This will
   greatly reduce the amount of information any single router needs to
   maintain with the core routers possibly not requiring any non-routing
   information at all.
   </t>
   <t>
   With normal OSPF, every router in an OSPF area must have every piece
   of topological information and every intra-area IP or IPv6 prefix.
   With non-routing information, only the routers needing to share a set
   of information need be part of the corresponding sparse topology.
   For directly attached routers, one only needs to configure the
   desired topologies on the interfaces with routers requiring the non-
   routing information.  When the routers making up the sparse topology
   are not part of a uniconnected graph, two alternatives exist.  The
   first alternative is configure tunnels to form a fully connected
   graph including only those routers in the sparse topology.  The
   second alternative is use remote neighbors as described in
   Section 2.7.1.
  </t>
 <section title="Remote OSPF Neighbor">
   <t>
   With sparse topologies, OSPF routers sharing non-routing information
   may not be directly connected.  OSPF adjacencies with remote
   neighbors are formed exactly as they are with regular OSPF neighbors.
   The main difference is that a remote OSPF neighbor's address is
   configured and IP routing is used to deliver OSPF protocol packets to
   the remote neighbor.  Other salient feature of the remote neighbor
   include:
    <list style="symbols"> 
    <t>All OSPF packets have the remote neighbor's configured IP address
       as the IP destination address.</t>

    <t>The adjacency is represented in the router Router-LSA as a router
       (type-1) link with the link data set to the remote neighbor's
       configured IP address.</t>

    <t>Similar to NBMA networks, a poll-interval is configured to
       determine if the remote neighbor is reachable.  This value is
       normally much higher than the hello interval with 40 seconds
       RECOMMENDED as the default.</t>
    </list></t>

<section title="OSPF Transport Instance Information Encoding">
   <t>
   The format of the TLVs within the body of an LSA containing non-
   routing information is the same as the format used by the Traffic
   Engineering Extensions to OSPF <xref target="RFC3630"/>. The LSA payload consists of one
   or more nested Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplets.  The format of each
   TLV is:

     <artwork>

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

  </figure></t>
<t> 
   However, each unique application using the mechanisms defined in this
   document will have it's own unique ID.  Whether to encode this ID as
   the top-level TLV or make it part of the OSPF LSA ID is open for
   debate.
</t>
<t>
   The specific TLVs and sub-TLVs relating to a given application and
   the corresponding IANA considerations MUST for standard applications
   MUST be specified in the document corresponding to that application.

</section>
<section title="OSPFv3 Transport Instance Information Encoding">
